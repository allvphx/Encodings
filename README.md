# Isolation

Practice for a better understanding of the isolation levels mentioned in SQL.

Degree 0 - (skip)

Degree 1 - read uncommitted (done)

Degree 2 - read committed (TBD, using 2 version method)

Degree 2.5 - snapshot isolation (TBD, using MVCC)
- MVCC implementation
- the lost update detection by MVCC

Degree 3 - serializable (doing, using 2PL)

the Phantom is not considered, since only the item read is considered.
